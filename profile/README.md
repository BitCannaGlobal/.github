Having our roots in the cannabis industry we are positioned to tackle challenges existing in the industry around for example banking. Our platform will allow consumers and the industry to connect, while offering tools to help them transact as well!   
    
BitCanna has been found by and for the cannabis industry to solve issues around banking, identity and supply chain management. To fulfil this purpose in the cannabis industry it is important to be an impartial player in the industry offering utilities and services to each and everyone in the market, ranging from producers, to intermediaries to end consumers. This requires BitCanna to be more than just a company offering tools, but an interlinked set of features making one complete platform where everyone can find what they need; consumers, the industry and governments alike.
